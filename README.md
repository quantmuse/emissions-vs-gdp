In this notebook, we examine the dynamics of the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in 27 EU member states in a panel setting. 

This is inspired by this paper "The Relationship Between Economic Growth and CO2 Emissions in EU Countries: A Cointegration Analysis" by Mihaela Onofrei, Florentina Vatamanu and Elena Cigu: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.934885/full
